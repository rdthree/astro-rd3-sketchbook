These three implementations of a random walk algorithm illustrate different programming approaches applied to the same problem. I rewrote the simple program in a more functional style, which yielded yet another way to write it as an object oriented program.


### Traditional OOP Random Walk:
This version uses a classic object-oriented structure. It defines a Walker class that encapsulates the walker's position and behavior. The class has separate methods for moving (step) and displaying (show). Random movement is implemented using a switch statement based on a random number. The draw function calls step and show once per frame.

### Functional-Style Random Walk:
This implementation takes a more functional approach. It does not use a class structure, instead relying on functions and a single position variable. The step function combines both movement and drawing operations. It uses an array of direction vectors for movement choices.

### Refined OOP Random Walk:
This version maintains an object-oriented structure but incorporates some elements seen in the functional approach. The Walker class now includes a static array of direction vectors. The step method uses this array for movement, simplifying the code. It also moves the stroke color setting to the setup function. */}
