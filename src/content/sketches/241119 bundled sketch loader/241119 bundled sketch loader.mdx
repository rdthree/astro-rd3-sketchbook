Sketches are loaded and rendered using the Bundled Sketch Loader.  They are referenced in the MDX files using the following tags:

```jsx
<Sketch sketchId="babylon-test_241114" renderer="babylon" />
```
<Sketch sketchId="babylon-test_241114" renderer="babylon" />

<br/>

```jsx
<Sketch sketchId="threejs-test_241118" renderer="three"/>
```
<Sketch sketchId="threejs-test_241118" renderer="three"/>

<br/>

The Bundled Sketch Loader, renderers, and sketches each handle different parts of getting 3D graphics on screen:

### The Loader:
- Finds canvas elements on the page.
- Reads which 3D engine each sketch wants to use.
- Loads the right renderer and sketch files.
- Manages when sketches appear or disappear from the page.

### The Renderers (Three.js/Babylon.js):
- Set up the 3D environment.
- Create cameras and scenes.
- Handle window resizing.
- Run the animation loop.
- Provide the core 3D engine features.

### The Sketches:
- Create the actual 3D content.
- Define what objects appear.
- Control how things move and animate.
- Determine how users can interact.
- Focus purely on the creative aspects.

This separation lets artists and developers focus on making their sketches while the loader and renderers handle all the technical setup automatically.
