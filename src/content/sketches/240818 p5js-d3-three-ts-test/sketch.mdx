# Testing p5.js, D3.js, and Three.js

This document contains examples of three popular JavaScript libraries: **p5.js**, **D3.js**, and **Three.js**. Each section provides a brief explanation of the library followed by a test sketch that demonstrates basic functionality.

## p5.js

**p5.js** is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create visual and interactive experiences on the web. It was designed to be a friendly and accessible tool for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, with a focus on making coding more inclusive and approachable.

## D3.js

**D3.js** (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. This flexibility makes it a powerful tool for creating custom charts and graphs.

## Three.js

**Three.js** is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create 3D graphics in the browser. It simplifies the WebGL API and provides many built-in functions for creating and manipulating 3D objects, lights, and cameras. It's widely used for creating 3D web applications, games, and interactive visualizations.

## Bablyon.js

**Bablyon.js** is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create 3D graphics in the browser. It simplifies the WebGL API and provides many built-in functions for creating and manipulating 3D objects, lights, and cameras. It's widely used for creating 3D web applications, games, and interactive visualizations.
