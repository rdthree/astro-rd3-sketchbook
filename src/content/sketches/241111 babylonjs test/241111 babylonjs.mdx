# Babylon.js Test

**Title: Breaking Down a Babylon.js Sketch Setup in Astro**

Let's break down how these files actually work together to show a spinning sphere.

The MDX file is just a content page that says "put a 3D sketch here" using this tag:

```jsx
<BabylonSketch sketchId="babylon-test_241114" />
```

The `BabylonSketchLoader.astro` creates a canvas on the page and loads the right sketch file based on that `sketchId`. It has a manager that watches for these canvas elements and sets them up. When it finds one, it looks in the sketches folder for a matching file name.

The `babylonRenderer.ts` file handles the basic Babylon.js setup stuff – it imports the needed Babylon.js parts, creates the scene, and sets up a default camera. Think of it as the basic setup that every 3D sketch needs to work.

Finally, `babylon-test-simple.ts` is where the actual 3D stuff happens. It creates a sphere, adds some lighting, and makes the camera fly around in a circle. It can do this because the renderer already set up all the boring foundation stuff.

So when you view the page:

1. The loader makes a canvas
2. It finds and loads the sketch file
3. The renderer sets up the basic 3D scene
4. The sketch code runs and creates the sphere
5. The camera starts moving around it

That's really all there is to it – just files working together to put a 3D scene on a webpage.
